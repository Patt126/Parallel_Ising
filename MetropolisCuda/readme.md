# Project Structure Explanation
The structure of this CUDA program is specifically designed for development on cloud-based platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle. 
 The streamlined code structure, avoiding traditional `.cuh` and `.cu` files and `Makefile`, is more practical for these environments,
 focusing on ease of use and efficiency in building and executing the program.
